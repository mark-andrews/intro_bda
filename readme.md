# Introduction to Bayesian Data Analysis

(more info to follow)

## Teaching Format

This course will be primarily hands-on and workshop based. There will be some lecture style presentation, i.e., using slides, introducing and explaining key concepts. 

The course will take place online using Zoom in two sessions on June 26:

* 10am-12pm
* 1pm-3pm
 
All sessions will be video recorded and made available to all attendees as soon as possible, hopefully soon after each 2hr session.

Although not strictly required, using a large monitor or preferably even a second monitor will make the learning experience better, as you will be able to see my RStudio and your own RStudio simultaneously.

## Assumed quantitative knowledge

We assume familiarity with linear regression analysis, and the major concepts of classical inferential statistics (p-values,
hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, model comparison, etc). Some
familiarity with common generalized linear models such as logistic or Poisson
regression will also be assumed.

## Assumed computer background

R experience is desirable but not essential. Although we will be using R extensively, all the code that we use will be made available, and so attendees will just to add minor modifications to this code. Attendees should install R and RStudio on their own computers before the workshops, and have some minimal familiarity with the R environment. 

## Equipment and software requirements

A computer with a working version of R or RStudio is required. R and RStudio are both available as free and open source software for PCs, Macs, and Linux computers. R may be downloaded by following the links here https://www.r-project.org/. RStudio may be downloaded by following the links here: https://www.rstudio.com/.
All the R packages that we will use in this course will be possible to download and install during the workshop itself. In some cases, some additional open-source software, for example Stan, will need to be installed to use some R packages. 

Full installation instructions can be found [here](software.md).
